# ENIGMA Protocols for Imputation and Genetic Associations of Diffusion Tensor Imaging Metrics

Anyone is welcome to use these protocols for their projects! If you use the protocols on this site for projects outside of ENIGMA, please include a  reference to the ENIGMA main page (http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/) so that your readers and reviewers know about it as well. 

### ENIGMA-DTI GWAS
**GWAS Meta-Analysis of Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) Metric ROIs**

*   [Pre Imputation Quality Control (QC) Protocol - Updated (April 16, 2024)](https://github.com/ENIGMA-git/ENIGMA_DTI_GWAS/tree/main/Pre%20Imputation%20Quality%20Control%20Protocol). This protocol explains first different scenarios related to different levels of previous genotype processing (e.g., if you have contributed to previous ENIGMA GWAS versus if you have not previously processed (all) the genotype data). Please note: This Pre Imputation QC Protocol is meant to be run after you have completed the ENIGMA DTI phenotype extraction and QC protocols found [here](https://github.com/ENIGMA-git#enigma-dti-imaging).

*   Imputation protocols: Under construction
